This is a draft of note on Chapter 1
====================================


During reading this book, we have a lot of ideas that flash into our mind. They may be immature and even wrong. It does not matter! Becasue what we encourge is **sharing** what we think and what we know. An immature idea or understanding is much better than no idea.

So I think we can commit to draft before completing formal latex note of each chapter. This draft is a markdown file because it is easy to use. We can write in any language such as English,中文... Anything that can express your idea!

We can take this draft as a **developing** and **temporary** version of final Latex note.

We can start to compose Latex note when we finish one chapter.
