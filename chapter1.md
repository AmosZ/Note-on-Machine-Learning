1.Introduction
------------------------
**Training Set** : is used to tune the **parameters** of an adaptive model

- What about adaptive model? How to select adaptive model? 
- How to design or select an good adaptive model??

**Learning phase** : The precise form of the function(adaptive model) is determined during the training phase

**General Workflow**:

1. Preprocess:
	- Normalization : For example : transforming different size of pics to the same one
	- Reduction : Reduce dimension or quantity, to speed up comuputation. `How to reduce dimension/quantity while preserving the information in those data is not easy.`
2. Training
3. Test 
4. Output result

**Classification:**

- supervised learning : Training data comprise examples of the input vectors **along with** their corresponding target vectors
	- classification:decrete 
	- regression:continuous

- unsupervised learning : Training data consists a set of input vector x **without** any corresponding target value
	- cluster : to discover group of similar examples
	- density estimation : to determine the distribution of data within the input space.

- visualization : to project the data from a high-dimensional space down to two/three dimensions for the purpose of visualization. Data visualization is a hot field now. Is this can be used to preprocess data set,as mention in Reduction?

- reinforcement learning: finding suitable actions to take in a given situation in order to maximize a reward.
	Make a balance of exploration and exploitation
	- exploration : explore the unknow space.
	- exploitation : make use of the actions that are known to yield a high reward.

Do you remember PSO ???
$$
V(t+1) = w*V(t) + C_{1}*R_{1}*(P(t) - X(t)) + C_{2}*R_{2}*(G(t) - X(t))
$$
$$
X(t+1) = X(t) + V(t+1)
$$

It also need a balance between **exploitation** and **exploration**. But it has a global attraction when particle explore the unknown space. It is lucky...

**Deep Learning** : a new branch of machine learning. [wikipedia][deep_learning]
